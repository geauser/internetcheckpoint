I felt hopeless, like my existence in this world was nothing but futile, like I was fated for pain. I just wanted an end to it all. I wanted to die. But being an avid fan of music, I just wanted to listen to my favorite music one last time. This included soundtracks to my favorite games. As I opened my playlist and listened through, I laid, crying, bawling my eyes out, and planning what I would write for my friends and family. That's when I reached a certain piece of music. That piece was Forest Interlude. I curled up in a ball and cried. I bawled. Memories of DKC2 flashed through my mind... the first time I played it... a gift from my grandmother. I replayed it, and kept doing so for an hour, bawling all the while. I didn't want to make my grandmother upset. I wanted to enjoy the beauty of this world, despite my pain. Now, here I am. I've met the love of my life, have wonderful and kind friends who I love very much and love me very much, I'm on the cusp of beginning college, and most importantly, I'm alive. The point is that life does get better. I never believed it myself but it does. And someday you'll have something or someone to thank for hanging in there. And your struggles, your pain, will just be a memory. You have people who love you. Who care for you. Even if it doesn't seem like it. We love you, this comment section. Somewhere, there will always be someone to talk to and love you. I promise. I'd be lying if I said it isn't still tough sometimes. It is. But the majority of it is gone. Recovery from depression is not a constant upward slope. But even if you have bad days, it does get better. Please be kind to yourself and don't hurt yourself. Stay safe. Thank you, Forest Interlude.", "time": "3 päeva eest", "channel": "UCG217nxOtQftR1kP1uxV7mw"}

I was absolutely friendless with no direction in high school. I had no job, my depression was bad, and I was just going through the motions. The goal was to go to college because, well, that's what I was expected to do. I was terrified, I thought that I would never make a friend and that I'd have a degree in something that I wasn't cut out for. I had a stutter that was so unbelievably bad it sounded like I was beatboxing when I tried to say good morning.\n\nI looked at the mirror and told myself \"my stomach looks awful. My legs and knees hurt. When I stand straight up, my fat forms 3 rolls on either side... I mean I can get it down to 2 no problem, right? As silly as that sounds, that motivated me.\n\nFast forward 2 months later, and I'm ~230 pounds and eating much better. My college offered us an opportunity to do charity work or go camping or some other trip so we can make some friends before classes start. I'm in the bus headed to a Habitat for Humanity house that we need to build. I'm playing pokemon on my phone on an emulator when some dude arches his head over the bus seat and asks \"are you really playing pokemon\"\n\nIt was all too familiar, but instead of staying silent, my nerdy confidence took over.\n\n\"Hell yeah dude! My Venosaur is kickass, I'm on the 6th gym\"\n\nSilence.\n\nI sat there wishing that I had never been able to talk, embarrassed out of my mind, knowing that I'd have to work with these people for a few days and my opportunity to make friends was over and I kept running over these thoughts over and over again in my head. From the front of the bus i heard fast footsteps \"BRO WHAT GEN ARE YOU PLAYING\"\n\nI smiled as I showed him the fire red rom on my phone. He sat down next to me and I showed off my team and we were having a good time as more and more people came out the woodwork and started hopping into the conversation. That night, I had a few people that I was at least cool with, and when we got back to the dorms, I looked at myself in the mirror.\n\n\"I mean... I gotta look my best for my new friends. What's getting those 2 rolls down to 1?\n\nFast forward 3 months later, and I'm ~200 pounds and finally my back and legs don't hurt nearly as much on a daily basis. I can actually run now!\nIt's October, I was reading something and remember a character saying that it takes one good deed to make a person's entire day, so I attempted to do this. I saw a guy outside and attempted to make friends with him by patting his back and making a bad joke. In hindsight, that was stupid. He was drunk as all hell and turned to me and thought I wanted to fight. I tried to say a bunch of things, but I stumbled over my feet and my words and it came off as \"Step off, dick\". He was not happy. We were right outside my dorm building, so I scanned my way in and ran up to a random group of guys that I saw hanging out in a lounge. \n\n\"Okay, I don't know you, but pretend we're friends. Some drunk dude wants to fight me and I really don't wanna deal with that right now\".\n\nA few sporadic laughs here and there ring out before I get the okay, and I sat there waiting. I looked over and saw them playing some weird game on their computers. Being a handheld and console kid I was confused as all hell. \"Hey, what game are you guys playin?\"\n\n\nFast forward a year and a few months later. I'm 170 pounds and lifting. I really hit it off with that group. I'm living with them all, taking up a chunk of a dorm. I'm finally starting to feel really good about myself. We do a bunch of stupid stuff as a group. I met a few friends of a friends that I noticed also had some self esteem problems. I wanted to give them the push that I never got, so I invited them to my dorm to hang out and play some video games. They were all great people, albeit shy and nervous. They needed confidence, so I called them together and boomed out:\n\"Fellas, we're going to the gym!\"\n\nFast forward to present day. I'm still 170 pounds, and have been doing exercises at home to stay sane and in shape. The pandemic has me cooped up inside and I missed an entire year of hanging with those guys... or rather I would say that had I not had their discords and phone numbers and messaged all of them multiple times a week. Unlike people from before, the relationships aren't one sided. I will go out of my way to talk to them and they would do the same for me. A few of these people and I want to start a business after college and we are taking all the steps necessary to do so. In what? Well, most of us have been unified by one thing: video games. Had it have not been for my love of games and desire to take the first step, I never would have been happy in college and I would have stayed directionless. I most likely would've given up trying to lose weight after a few months, too. So, I hope to be able to make a game that could inspire at least one conversation and be the strength that at least one person needs to overcome their challenges. I want a game that me and my friends make to be that catalyst. Luckily, most of us are either Computer Science or Game Design majors.\n\nI'm so happy. Some nights, I will sit down in bed and cry not because I'm sad, but because I truly can't believe that I'm this happy. Even something as awful as a pandemic couldn't break me. I made friends, am trying to build a company, gained my confidence back, and lost 100 pounds to boot.\n\nTo anyone reading this, if life has got you down and you feel like giving up, don't. Life is what you make of it. Bad times will suck, yeah, but I promise that the good times will be all the sweeter when they come. I believe in you!\n\n\nWould you like to save your game?\nYes       >Absolutely\n\nSaving a lot of data...\n\nData Saved!  3-25-2021   12:58", "time": "1 nädala eest", "channel": "UCK1vuYZBSSY3FXeLyzdou-g"}

Then in 2010 everything started to downhill. First my friend group kind of dissolved. Then my boiyfriend dumped me, and then we had to put out cat down.\r\nBut the worst was what happened surrounding my mother. While going to college, I went to these clubspaces and made some friends there.\n\r\nFebruary 2011, my mother was dying of cancer. Someone from my old friend group, Tin, trolled me on steam the night I found out my mother had a year left to live. I was having a complete breakdown and exploded on them for picking the worst time possible to troll me. When I apologized to them, Tin demanded I admit to being a shitdisturber. Not wanting anymore bullshit, I ignored them and signed off of Steam. I posted to my wall, explaining the situation and asking for ppl to understand, but my cry for compassion was twisted as me using my mother's illness as an excuse to get away with being a bitch. That triggered someone well liked in the group, Kelly, who had previously lost her mother, which in turn pissed everyone else in the group off.\r\nI remember the day she confronted me about it, I was warned by a then-friend, Shannon, that there was drama in the club so I went to investigate. I was confronted, verbally abused and left crying in the Oliver's caf with Shannon, while everyone else followed Kelly back to the club to confort her.\n\nThe situation was made ten times worse later that night by a certain person named Mathew, who took the opportunity to write a huge post on fb tearing me down, on which everyone else joined in taking a public jab at me. Matt was seen as the community leader at the time. He could have used his power to calm the situation down, instead he made things worse. To this day, I suspect that troll is the one who twisted my words to trigger Kelly and cause all of this, and that he also had Matt in the palm of his hand, but i digress; Matt's post convinced most of them to ditch me.\n\r\nThat devastated me in an already overwhelmed state, and I attempted suicide a few nights later.\r\nThat summer, I saw that my former friends were all having a big party, \"What Killed the Dinosaurs? The Bad Movie Night.\", and I wasn't invited. Shannon saw how much it hurt me, so she invited to her bf's party instead, and that's where I met Paul.\r\nThe following school year of 2011-2012 went by without much incident. The people who had ghosted me slowly added me back, Matt even apologized for his shit, and things seemed to be on the up and up. It looked like all this drama was behind us. I was wrong.\r\n(these were friends I had made in the clubspaces I used to hang out at with my old friend group, samatha sarah ccameron and amber. Samantha and sarah had a falling out, and graduated so they stopped going to the clubs, amber left too, which only left cameron. Cameron is still my friend, but everyone else is gone. here ill explain sorry for the disjointedness of all this)\r\n(oh and amber's still here. anyway)\n\r\nAfter I graduated, I decided to go visit the club in Fall 2012.\r\nI saw someone I knew, Sarah, crying on someone's lap, and asked her what was up. She told me she was in an abusive relationship with Tin. For giving her the advice to leave him, Tin came at me on steam again, and I told him that he was an abuser, that he would not intimidate me and to go fuck himself, and I blocked him. Suddenly, Matt was trying to extort 100$ from me for 2 locks I had broken the year before, which should've only cost 42$. Where did that come from? Well, Tin was the club's Treasurer that year. He was trying to get back at me for standing up to him and helping his victim escape, and he was doing it through Matt, who was going apeshit on me on MSN for refusing to pay 100$. I insisted I should only have to pay what I owe, which was 42$. He kept freaking out on me, so finally I threatened to get a lawyer involved, and that's when he backed down. I still paid the money I owed for the locks I had broken but I blocked Matt, having had enough of his bullshit, and that's when suddenly a bunch of ppl from the group ghosted me for good.\r\nWhy was I ghosted when Matt was clearly the one in the wrong? Because Tin. They ghosted me bc Tin told them to. Tin and Matt told them all sorts of shitty things about me and they believed them. They don't hold Tin or Matt to any of their shitty actions though bc they don't want the same abuse that happened to me to happen to them. They turn a blind eye to every shitty thing Tin and Matt do. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand there's an extremely toxic abuse dynamic at play in that group.\r\nSo, remember that party I went to with Shannon, and that guy I met named Paul? From 2011 to 2015 wer were together. I was isolated from whoever was left, only hung out with him and his friends. In 2014, I became close friends with a girl name d Ariel, a member of that old groiup who ghosted me. But that was probably a manufactured relationship manipulated into existance by Paul. because it turned out paul was a psychopath.\n\r\nPaul was extremely abusive when no one was around. The night he left, we had a huge fight. I tried to escape the situation by running upstairs. He chased me and when I ran into my TV room and closed the door behind me, he started pounding on it and trying to push his way in. When he did manage to get through the door, I panicked, picked up a glass bottle and threw it at him, and then slammed the door again when he backed out. The bottle broke, and cut his finger very deep. He used that cut to get everyone present during the situation on his side. Nevermind all the crazy abusive stuff he had just pulled in front of them, no, I was the bad guy, and once he had them convinced, he left to my then bff's house, who later became his new gf.\n\nHe posted a picture of the wound on facebook, and because of that and previous drama from years ago that never really went away, most of the friends I had left from Dawson believed him, and ghosted me. I couldn't tell them that a week earlier he had raped me, and that's why I was scared enough to throw that glass bottle at him.\n\nI filed a police report, I warned everyone who would listen to me about him, and I warned her. I've done everything I can, and I'm sorry for the friends I lost who believed such awful things about me.\n\nI was too scared to tell them that Paul had raped me. I was too scared bc of previous drama that happened back in 2011, that drama bebing the stuff with matt tin and kelly.\n\r\nI was too scared to tell this story for such a long time, because if asking for understanding while my mom was dying was twisted into me using my mom as an excuse to get away with being a bitch, then asking for understanding for the outbursts I had after being raped would just be twisted into me using my rape as an excuse to get away with being a bitch. I couldn't handle the idea of my rape being trivialized as just some excuse--and Mathew is in part responsible for it all, because of that fucking post he made publicly tearing me down. Had he not posted that, I would've never lost my support system, I would've never gone to that party with Shannon, and I would've never been raped.\n\r\nSo I spent the better parts of 2016-2018 telling those involved off for their part in my current situation and blocked them, and the rest rebuilding what I had back in 2009. Now I'm okay, I live with my fiance, who is very supportive and loving, we're making a game together which is something ive always wanted to do, and I have my old friends back. \r\n\r\nThey're finally gone!\n\r\nNow I'm making up for lost time doing everything I wanted to do but was ay too depressed; streaming, youtube, game dev, freelance illustration, writing a fanfic, etc. I feel free. I'm finally free from all of this. I feel amazing, and I can't believe I was able to go through all of this and come out the other side stronger and healthier than ever. I know what friendship feels like now, I know when someone's being an a-hole to me and I waste no time removing that from my life, I have healthy boundaries and I enforce them, and I'm surrounded by nothing but friends. \n\nI'm the strongest person I know. I used to think I was a weak pos,but nothing could be farther from the truth.", "time": "1 kuu eest (muudetud)", "channel": "UCrZ2SrMbS8xdtVRg1502SGQ"}

I still look back and it all feels like I dont deserve my current life style while still wanting more success and feel like I do I don't deserve more all at the same time. Ruminations run my mind and every day its a struggle to balance the positive and negative because I know I need both to function. Just driving to work or tidying a room or even to simply sleep can become easy or hard in an instant. And while life is supposed to be hard and I get that I still have yet to wait for the day when I can just take it easy just for a little while. I am grateful I don't for a second forget I am blessed. My conflict is internalized and unseen maybe I'll get my wishes maybe soon ill finally marry and have kids before I go gray. Maybe rest is tomorrow and I just don't know it but for the moment I just enjoy fixing up my house enjoying music visiting old friends working hard at a job I hate and enjoying my new car with very little sleep.

My father is also hit hard by this loss as she was his mother, together me and my father are trying to fight through this step by step, but as he is getting better... I am getting worse, my mental breakdowns have become so frequent that it's becoming annoying to me and I'm hit by suicidal thoughts more and more.\n\nI just wish things could be different, you know.

I feel like I have no special place on this world for myself. I'm an artist and that's what I wanna do for a living. I don't need luxury and a lot of money. I just want to make what I love. Art in any way... but here in my town and country it's hard to make money with that... and that fact is tearing me apart because I can't deal with people anymore... I got my closest friends around me and I'm fine with that. But I can't handle people any more... I can't... I don't want to... I don't understand people. Why are people treating each other the way they are doing actually... to see the world going worse and worse each day makes me leave this place earlier than I was supposed to... \nBut now I stumble across those mysterious recommendations from YT which gives me nostalgic flashbacks to one if the best games ever made blessed with the best soundtrack list ever created, and reading so many comments from so many strangers around the world who are suffering with their own problems and most of them creating special checkpoints in their lives which are a big step for them, is making me feel so much less depressed. For a short moment I lose those depressions and thoughts because it shows me that my problems are truly not that much of a big deal. I should learn to appreciate what I have and can do. \n\nI wish you guys all the best I can imagine ! I hope those nostalgic flashbacks and feelings will be as special for you as it is for me.\n\nThis soundtrack kicks me back into my childhood where I used to play this game with my dad every time he came home from work. This memory is one of the greatest of all time.\n\nWho ever you are, who uploaded those soundtracks years ago, thank you!

It feels like certain parts of my life have been on pause and other parts are continuing.\nFor college I’m majoring in Computer Science so right now I’m learning C.

I've met my first actual love which between us its a bit weird and awkward considering we both haven't been in a relationship before but I do feel like there's something special between us that i never felt before. On the other hand my past has just been full of stress and high expectations. Everyone says i should go to college but i haven't even came close to thinking about that, ans the fact that i might not even be good enough for it. Somewhere in my childhood I somehow got to be \"gifted\" somehow but in hindsight it would have been better to just be with everyone else. Being the youngest by a decade from my brothers and being \"gifted\" put alot of attention on me and so either way my mother was too overprotective and never letting me go anywhere alone, always feeling like i need them or ill be lost and confused, and my mother never took me to meet new kids or outside anywhere really, so i didnt have friends growing up, and the ones i did have always left, always. At that point i never even felt a strong bond between me and someone else, so i wasnt even lonely, after all, you cant be lonely if you never experienced friendship before. But later in life i found a good friend of mine that i talked to and had fun with the rest of those 3ish years, actual friendship, now i would actually feel something if i was with no one around, which could be even worse, but that one friend eventually left but i made a friend quickly after, and we had plenty of time together, then i became more social, making people laugh, laughing with them, but soon after a fieldtrip together me and my friend separated, i felt alone in those months after, my friend left me, not even because they have to move or something, but because they disliked me, not even being able to look me in the face. Even other kids felt pity towards me. But by that time i was a completely different person, so i started to make friends with everyone, instead of sitting there alone, i talked to those people near me and i felt friendship toward them, proving that im not a sad lonely kid anymore that i can be like everyone else. At the same time i would make friends with my neighbours, who lived there just as long as me (my whole life) which tells you how much my mother was protective over me. Then i met my future crush and became the best friends.\nThen of course the pandemic came which let me spend even more time with my crush and even develop feelings. So yeah basically my life story so far, at school i talk to people at lunch not anywhere else sadly cause everyone is quiet and shyer than me, and again the situation with my crush is happening so yeah my life has been crazy these past years . \nIf theres one things to remember from this is to have faith in yourself and your decisions.", "time": "6 kuu eest", "channel": "UC8z6Kh37RX8uFNxxNGYgt9Q"}

Things have changed so much in the last year; March 2020 felt like a lifetime ago. I don't know if it's COVID or post-highschool, but I began to drift from my friendships and didn't speak with many of them for a few months. I've since reconnected with some in the past week, but we still haven't seen each other at all in a year. I'm also struggling trying to make new friends in college. Most of my classes don't even have Zoom meetings, but in the few that do, everyone stays muted.\r\nBack in September, when I was writing the original post, I was learning how to make a game in Unity. My original idea was really complicated for a beginner, so I scrapped it a few months in and started anew. The second game is now on itch.io, the first game I've ever released to the public. I'm still working on it regularly; I actually just implemented a few features yesterday.\r\nSo much has happened since September. I've moved for the first time in my life (albeit not far), contracted COVID-19 back in December along with the rest of my family (thankfully it wasn't serious), burned a few bridges, and rebuilt some other ones. Vaccinations are rolling out in my area, and I may be able to get it soon. I just hope this means we can go back to normal.\n\n\r\n\r\nI wonder how long it'll be until I come back to this video again and write another update.

I might as well say something. The one thing that is really bothering me is last year at school, i finally figured out how to be social and have friends, and I was happy with who i was for the first time in years. but now, since quarantine, i feel like ive forgotten everything i learned, and all of my social anxiety came back on the first day of school. I’m worried that the few friends I still see don’t like me anymore, and I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to be confident anymore. also, i used to know for sure what i wanted to do with my life, but now i don’t know at all. I feel like what i wanted to do was too much work and now i just want to be an artist or something. something less hard and more enjoyable. I am really worried that i will choose wrong and go on the wrong path in life. I feel broken. Hopefully in the future, if I come across this comment, i will have fixed myself. hopefully.\n\nsaving...\n9/4/2020, 2:33 AM", "time": "7 kuu eest (muudetud)", "channel": "UCdb7qun_6oAUjF3_dCkwCPg"}

I've got a girlfriend who loves me dearly, and friends that enjoy having me in their lives. Sometimes, we can lose sight of how much we truly have. School is rough for me, but I'm on track to get a degree and pursue my career. I got lucky with my scholarships, so I have no debt to worry about.\n\nLife is good. Life is turbulent.

In a day which I lost all hope she come around me and hug me in a very seductive way; since I was sad and since I am a man with \"needs\" I accepted her game. Few months ago and with a crazy story in the meantime we started a formal relationship. We have been together 1 year and 3 days hehe. This is a totally weird relationship she is 3 years older than me and the only thig she do is fucking working all the time in her farm while I am a very relaxed man of 24 years that only play videogames and works when I can/have to. She is not into videogames neither music...

My anxiety is through the roof, can't finish university because of that because it's impacting my health but I have to find a job to live now so yeah. I'm stuck in a relationship with someone I'm not in love with because the way they're treating me is questionable and I miss one of my exes, the first one that I ever was in love with, you'll probably know the feeling like someone you'd truly do anything for, when you're with them, you feel more yourself than with everybody else even when you're on your own. They left me for someone else which wrecked me and that's not an understatement. I feel like giving up everyday when I wake up but can't because it would hurt my parents and the few friends I have but that's literally the only thread left I have. And finally, above all else, I feel guilty to feel like shit for such stupid bullshit like that when there are people having lives that are way worse than mine. So I wanted to apologise to everybody who is having way harder than me, I'm really sorry. I wanted to finish on a happy note but I don't know what I can say except they say it gets better with time so, if you want, if you ever feel like giving up watching this, know that somewhere there'll always be at least one person rooting for you and if I could I'd hug this comment section. Now it's time for me to get back on the road, I'll see you on the other side.

I'm starting to feel more excited when these pop up in my recommended feed now, and I don't entirely know why. I feel drawn to them now, no longer worried about coming across the wrong one at the wrong time. This might be a stretch, but maybe this is what people mean when they say that I'm meant to encounter them this way?\n\nTo recap from my last checkpoint, my partner had decided that they wanted to just be best friends with me, and I wasn't taking the change too well. I've had a history of bad breakups and abusive exes in the past that have tried to keep me emotionally invested in them in unhealthy ways even after they wanted to \"remain friends\", so it's hard for me to trust that this current partner-turned-platonic friend isn't going to turn out the same way. My self esteem has always been low, too, so this only reinforced my thoughts of being not good enough to have/keep a romantic partner. I used to have a group of friends that I could talk to before quarantine, but since then I haven't heard back from any of them, so maybe my problem is more that I don't have many people to talk to so I just get overly attached to the few people that do talk to me?\n\nAs of right now, I've been trying to put more time into the things I enjoy doing: making digital art, practicing animation, and I've recently picked up my old books that I loved writing so much during my middle school and early high school years. It helps to take my mind off things that still bother me, and I've been more productive now than I have been in weeks. Don't get me wrong, I'm still very lonely and my unhealthy thoughts still make it hard to rest easy in the evening, but I'm doing what I can to distract myself from those awful feelings and thoughts. This is the best I can do for myself, since I can't exactly ask for help at home. \n\nI should probably note that getting this all off my chest here is rather therapeutic. I don't know why, but it feels like a confessional- but without the religious undertones and the pressure of not wanting to be adhered to any one spiritual belief. Maybe at the next checkpoint I'll tell a bit more about myself as an individual?", "time": "7 kuu eest", "channel": "UC5VNWXhPbPsGW_b5WGPyquw"}

Not sure if I like the idea that I'm speedrunning life 😂 depends on what the goal is I suppose, haha.\nCheckpoint:\nI just woke up. Nothing different from my first checkpoint really. I guess I can talk about how I've spent a lot more time looking into the psychic abilities we may have, trying to reconcile these things with science and understand them without all the mysticism and myth surrounding many practical things we could do. I won't lie, weed helps to truly feel and recognize when this happens as you seem more connected and understood as you talk with people, or even watch videos over time and space. That's fun, wish it wasn't such a bastardized fun plant as we've made out to be lol. Oh well. Also still working hard on my music, excited to see where it goes. Catching ongoing wisdom as it comes. Playing up and down my fretboard hoping to reduce the bandwidth between its sounds and my brain to make them as a function. Also listening to more music to understand better how to compose, wondering if I should just be trying to win the lotto off feeling instead like intuitive greats like Kurt Cobain. We'll see. Other than that, trying to make friends with cool people on the internet, namely on twitter. But it's hard I guess, I think I enjoy people who are in their own little worlds, and I'd like to experience them. But to be in their own worlds they must be quite introverted, and you won't always find them wanting to share their world with others. It's a hit or miss game, either way it's cool I guess lol. Wow this one was a lot more positive than my first checkpoint at the other video. Hope you all have a wonderful day, and keep chasing your dreams.

This country, the USA doesn't care about the lives living here. Covid-19 has been a proven threat with viable ways to counter it and this country doesn't do a damn thing. I don't want to die, but it's also getting harder to live. For a long time I had to put up with a toxic \"friend\" of mine. Recently my other friends in the group finally opened their eyes after so long to his behavior and how much he's babied by everyone. For a long time I thought I was going crazy cause they would disagree with me when I would bring it up. Why on Earth did I put up with this guy for so long? Did I believe there was good in him? Did I believe we as a group of friends would sail into a sunset of dreams? I don't know what I thought, what I want right now is to finish my Pharmacy Technician course to provide for my fiancee. She's not in a good spot either... But that's not my story to tell, I just want what remaining friends and family I have to survive this horrible outbreak in country that's intent on reopening everything no matter what. \nSaved - Saturday, July 18 6:20 pm", "time": "8 kuu eest", "channel": "UCc9WEGuhy_6gZcoSfde9pNg"}

Someone close in my life is having detrimental health issues and I'm worried ill lose them for good. Also, me and my girlfriend are on a bad note right now.

But I think in actuality, the checkpoint isn't here to magically fix your life... its to encourage you to help yourself. Its a resting point to regroup. Just calm down and let the world flow. It allows you to gather your thoughts and unwind for a bit. Then when you are ready to explore again, you will be ready for the future.

None of us are really, but I feel as if this isn't my first play through or my last. I feel as if we all are here for a reason. This video of course, one of the 4 so-called internet checkpoints; I'm not too sure why I'm here but I am so I might as well add.\nI'm currently sitting in my room, in the middle of the Florida riots for George Floyd, coronavirus pandemic, and so far I've been pretty lucky in life but this year seems to have rolled a 1 on its CON save. Hopefully we all make it out alive for more years to come as a civilization. I'm a sophomore in highschool, I have a girlfriend, starting college classes next year for dual enrollment, getting a job and have anything I could ever want. But it's boring, I can't explain it but it is I don't know why either, I have all the friends I could want a great and loving family. But I feel out of place here in this world, it's not that I'm depressed, it's that I feel like there are so many others that could've came as a result from my parents meeting and I just got lucky winning. It's weird, I'm the only person in my house who doesn't like sports, you look at the rest of my cousins and siblings and they're all like 5'4\" slim but then there's me, 6'2\" broad shoulders towering over them, I'm the only one who is doing anything for college of the 5 of us (me and my brother and cousins) my oldest cousin is the one I'm most worried about tbh, he has no plans in life but if he wanted too he could do anything, my brothers only plan is the NHL, same with my youngest cousin, and the middle one she is just pampered by her had and ma being the only girl of the 5 of us. So I just feel kinda out of place for how I am but who knows we're all here for a reason maybe mine is to do something great but yeah that's enough of me I'm starting to sound narcissistic, how are y'all?", "time": "9 kuu eest", "channel": "UCNm1fMcamuGpVBFb_Ywqzsw"}

A ton of people in these comments are saying this is their second or third, I hope you all have a nice time if you see the rest.

I'm glad that we've all made it here though, it's a nice place to convene, no matter where you're coming from.\nThe visuals of this one are super pretty. And the music's alright too. I really really preferred the music of the first one, though, the one with vines and sky. This is still good though.\nI don't have much to talk about? I've been reading a bit over the past few days, like I said I would at checkpoint 3 or 4. It's pretty good. Lots of people lose interest in reading after childhood, I'm trying to not let that happen to me. I have to confess that I haven't made any progress on what I mentioned at checkpoint one.

I didn’t even know she was coming back but when she did I realized maybe I did like her back. Self-confidence then pounded me again saying that she got over me and I believed it.\n\nFast forward about a month and then guess what? She and one of my best friends get into a relationship. I told no one about her so it wasn’t his fault.\n\nIt was painstakingly hard to not be uncomfortable when she was always with my friend when we were at school, but I feel like I got over it. \n\nIn the end we’re just friends who had a weird past, but that’s probably the best outcome.", "time": "9 kuu eest (muudetud)", "channel": "UCQREwXqpKTOPViPrsPcg9Eg"}

A stream friend [who I never met in person] and cousin of mine helped pay my rent off. Im so fucking grateful to Lone and Adrian. Real homies do exist out there. Be patient your people are out there looking for you.\n\n Oddly enough despite my negative feelings. Im hella excited to be single and work on myself. I was with my co parent since 17-25 and from 25-27 with my recent now ex gf. I need a relationship with myself now! I wont ever let anything or anyone in life stop me from achieving my goals no matter what. The hardest battle is finding the will to do it. Motivation on most days isn't enough. Some days I push extremely hard with 0 motivation.\n\nRemember Friends exists. Love exists. Kill your ego. Love yourself. Treat everyone with respect. Know your worth. You're amazing. You're beautiful. Keep moving forward. Accept your mistakes. Keep learning and growing. Follow your goals, dreams, and desires. Feed your mind positive self talk.

We began with high tensions between the US and Iran and then the Australian fires became really big news. \nThen soon after word of the “mysterious” virus in Wuhan became big. It was identified as a Coronavirus and was spreading rapidly throughout China. Most people in the US thought it wouldn’t be a big deal, including the president. The first confirmed case in the US was in Seattle, WA. From there cases slowly rose as officials tried to keep the virus under control. \nIn March, I got out of school for spring break, and I never returned. Schools were being shut down as well as non-essential businesses. The virus from that point on infected a lot of people. I liked watching the “Yakko’s World but coronavirus cases” on YouTube. Eventually the US became the number 1 country with COVID-19 cases. Life has been pretty stagnant until recently. \nA man named George Floyd was murdered by a cop, and it set the cap off for so many protests around the US and even other countries. Riots have broke out, but there are still many peaceful protests. My state has declared a State of Disaster in response to the riots. I hope the outcome of this will be a good one and a real change happens. \n\nTo look back on in the future and remember 2020 and what has happened\n\nMuch Love~", "time": "10 kuu eest", "channel": "UCJxTG1BvoUmc5dnTQ-_pYLg"}

So fuck it.\n\nI'm relatively young, fourteen years old at the moment. My only interest currently is getting good at super smash brothers ultimate and becoming a competitive splatoon player. Atm in covid-19 quarantine.\n\nNow its time to talk about my failures as a human being. Where do I start?\n\nI am extremely self conscious and care to much about what people think of me, my ego is extremely important to me. Because of this I get very scared whenever someone I care about sees a bad part of me. For example recently my sister was helping me with algebra. I couldn't do the things she had just said and was being extremely dumb. At the time my step brothers were in the same room playing xenoblade 2 chronicles remake (I think) in this situation I got extremely embarrassed that they saw that I was being stupid, so instead of passing it off because I was still learning how to do the math I got angry at my sister for still trying to explain concepts. Think of that, I got angry to the person for trying to help me! Even then I got very angry and told her to shut up any time she told me anything.\n\nDue to the current situation above I also get scared when I can't do things I normally can. I feel like a shell of what I'm supposed to be. An absolute failure of a human- one that can only dissapoint and do nothing good.\n\nI guess it's because I'm in my teenage years and still have plenty of time before I make any big decisions but I fear that. I fear that I'll make the wrong decisions and dissapoint everyone around me.\n\nI hope that I will solve my problems, and inner demon.

My Family has a negative outlook on almost everything and as good as a job i do by ignoring that, it affects me in ways i can’t describe. It hurts when they say mean things to me, pointing all their faults towards me that i haven’t done. I want to Give up, but if i want to make it in this Life, that ain’t an option. I know if i were to move out i’d be able to be more motivated to be a better Creator, but moving scares me. I’m afraid.\nI’m afraid i’ll be Homeless\nI’m afraid my Family will say: “i told you so”\nI’m afraid that i’ll have to give up my Dreams..\nBeing Creative is Difficult, making videos is difficult. \nJust recently my Mother decided to call me out on me having a bad attitude on life, yet anytime i try talk to her about my life or anything personal it ends with her being mad, even my dad it’s always been this way. Even as a Child. I ask for someone to listen, to help me vent, i have no one. As a child my Mother said to me: “this is your Home. No one can take it away from you” and just the other day she said: “just remember you live here for free, and i can take that away from you” even a Mother can and will hurt their Son. I feel like my Trust for my Family is slowly Fading..\nI want to have someone to talk with, someone like a friend, a friend who would listen, a friend who would care. Maybe some day...\n\nThe music is coming to an end, it’s 2 in the AM, and i’m tired. Maybe Tomorrow will be a better day. \nThank you reading, if you read this, that means i, as a creator, showed you apart of who i am, and reached out to you for help. \n\nGoodbye..\nFriend.\n\n15-03-20", "time": "1 aasta eest", "channel": "UCb9ZJDO4ms8FOI7z6RRsvJA"}

I mean, I don't know if there's just one specific reason.\n\nI've tried writing a couple of reasons, but none of them felt like satisfying answers, and I'm not sure how much hope or wisdom I can convey, but I'll do my best. Hell, at one point, I started going into a smallish story-of-my-life type of response, but for that I'd need to write a novel, though I'd blame most of the length to my ADHD. But, I digress.\n\nThe initial night before the day that I had planned to kill myself the year before, May 19th, I had a bad emotional breakdown. It was more draining than any others I've had before then. It was to the point that it drained any energy I'd had and I ended up spending the entire day in bed. I felt horrible about it, and instead I put it off until May 22nd, the Friday of that week. I thought that would be enough to get some of my affairs in order.\n\nOn a whim, I invited a couple of my friends to my house for that Thursday to try out a game that they'd wanted me to try out for a couple of years. Again, I don't really know why. I guess I just wanted to see them one last time. I hadn't planned on telling them anything.\n\nOne of my friends, the first friend that I actually made when I started school in kindergarten, arrived first, and we had a good time together until some of my family arrived with little to no notice beforehand. Suddenly I have my attention split five different ways, one to my brother and sister-in-law, one each for my niece and nephew, one to my friend who was also socially overwhelmed, and one way failing to calm my raising anxiety.\n\nSomehow I use an excuse that allows both of us to go outside, u bothered, when our other friend pulls into the driveway. He sees that we're overwhelmed, so he takes us on a little drive to eat and sit in his car to listen to music.\n\nWhile we're listening to music, we talk a bit. Again, I don't know why, but at some point, I just whispered, almost to myself that I had bought a rope. I couldn't even bring myself to look up as it dawned on my friends what I was alluding to.\n\nMy oldest friend climbed to the back seat and hugged me and comforted me while I had a breakdown that I had kept bottled up for years. Something about my friends just being there hit me so hard. I had believed and convinced myself that I must be sub-human — where I believed that I deserved all the bad things that happened to me in life, whereas anything good that happened to me were undeserved or fraudulent. Not only that, but I am an extremely touch-starved person, and being held and told that I did deserve love and compassion helped me to start chipping away at the toxic barriers I put around myself when I was younger.\n\nI don't know if my answer is enough to do your questions justice, but if you have anymore, I'll be happy to answer it.\n\nAnd it's never to late to try to become the best version of you that you can be.", "time": "7 kuu eest", "channel": "UCqAetxRfY6RojKzbfTq-WJQ"}

The day didn't go as planned, with family stopping in unannounced, and me becoming overwhelmed to the point where we had to leave the house to calm down.\n\nI still don't know why I quietly mentioned that I had the rope. I guess I still had a speck of hope somewhere within me that fought to see my future, to not want to constantly feel inhuman.\n\nNow, in a couple of weeks I'm going to a college that I never imagined that I'd make it to, to pursue a career that I had given up hope on, and soon I'll be able to get therapy and hopefully be able to transition and hopefully become the person I never thought I would reach.\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say is, if you can keep living, then I want to keep living too.

You've experienced a lifetime of Youtube drama, but you've also experienced the best of times. ASDF Movie, The good Youtube Rewinds, Jacksfilm's YGS 100, it's all under your belt.

Nothing but that endless sky, forever out of reach through the vines and entangled thorns. A peaceful, yet melancholy tune accompanies the wall between the realm of content, and the realm of the unknown that stands just inches away. You float here, on the inside, looking out into what else could be.\r\n\r\nYou contemplate. Would it be worth it to break out? To struggle through the trees and make it into the vast, foggy emptiness, forever to run into a void of dim clouds and gentle music? Or are you content to turn back into the familiar territory, and return to the Guitar Hero Memes and Vinesauce monthlies, the Relaxing Video Game Music mixtapes and perfect game speedruns?\r\n\r\nPerhaps, just maybe, it's alright to stay here for a moment. Or for a little while.\r\n\r\nTo listen to the music, and look outside at what could be , just beyond your realm.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the internet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n~You found: Edge 3/4~", "time": "1 aasta eest", "channel": "UCUK-WU6wrHGHCPNMAAlZUTg"}

I did many stupid things and I was even one step close to ruin my life. It started on January, 2019. Then for some surprises of life I had the chance to meet the most beautiful (sexy) girl of my Uni. In a day which I lost all hope she come around me and hug me in a very seductive way; since I was sad and since I am a man with \"needs\" I accepted her game. Few months ago and with a crazy story in the meantime we started a formal relationship. We have been together 1 year and 3 days hehe. This is a totally weird relationship she is 3 years older than me and the only thig she do is fucking working all the time in her farm while I am a very relaxed man of 24 years that only play videogames and works when I can/have to. She is not into videogames neither music... Sometimes I do not know how we reach hapiness being a couple but I can say that I love that woman. \r\n\r\nThings and treasures comes to you when you never imagine and from you will never figure it out.", "time": "7 kuu eest", "channel": "UCnCl3DrAyFCVBt_bbWKpICw"}

I lost my mom to cancer after she fought for several years. The last six months of her life were the hardest days in my 31 years alive. I have never cried and laughed so much ever with her. She too loved watching me play my SNES for hours on end, asking if there was anything she could do to help me clear any level i was having issues with (even though she was horrible at video games). After my father left her when I was 11, she and i became best friends as i grew up. We would talk in the late night hours about relationships i was in and out of. This coming March will be 3 years since her passing and not a day goes by that i dont miss her and hope that I make her proud of the choices ive made in my life! Thank you again for sharing this and I hope as everyday passes, it gets easier and a little brighter for us!", "time": "5 kuu eest", "channel": "UC0h6mtZc4tdf-M7IRS3lNFQ"}
